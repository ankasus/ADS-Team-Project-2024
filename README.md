## How to use the app
 The first step is to have all necessary packages installed.
 These can be found in the requirements.txt file.
 
Next, run the main.py app. Then, you can run the React webapp
simply by running "npm run dev" from your terminal. You should
get a link to a web-app, in which you can add and view the job offers.
By pressing the corresponding buttons, you are able to update and delete
the offers. None of the actions cannot be reversed!
